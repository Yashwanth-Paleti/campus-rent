Campus Rent 🏫

Campus Rent is a student-centric web platform designed to help college students rent, lend, and discover essential items within their campus community — safely, affordably, and temporarily.

The platform aims to reduce unnecessary purchases, promote reuse, and make student life more economical.

🚀 Problem Statement

College students often need items like:

Calculators

Textbooks

Novels

Lab equipment

Daily-use electronics

These are usually required for a short duration, yet students are forced to buy them new.
Campus Rent solves this by enabling peer-to-peer rentals inside the campus ecosystem.
